#### Add up the numbers
---
You are given a random positive number between 1 and 1000.

Add up all the numbers from 1 to the number you were given.
For example, if the input is 4 then you should return 10, because 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10.

Examples:
```js
const input = 4; ➞ 10
const input = 17; ➞ 153
const input = 600; ➞ 180300
```
