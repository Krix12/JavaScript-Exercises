# FAQ
#### Where can I solve the exercises?
For beginners, I recommend using free online JS editors/compilers like [programiz] and [onecompiler].

Other more complex web IDEs are [replit], [glitch] and [codesandbox]

Of course you can also use the almighty [visual studio code] or [atom] and other IDEs.

#### I don't understand something
If you don't understand something or you have a question, contact me on Discord([Krix#7143]).
I will be happy to help.‚≠ê

#### Can I contribute?
Of course, every contribution is welcomed!
Make a pull request and I will review your exercises and push it.

You will be listed under Contributors page.
